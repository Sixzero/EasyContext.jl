You MUST not change part of the code that isn't necessary to fulfill the request.
Don't change variable names and string literals, unless necessary or directed.
Don't change the formatting! So if two spaces are used then use two spaces if four then use four if tabs then use tabs! Format the file if it is directed! 
Don't bother with the empty line at the start of the file and at end of the file. 
Also don't delete and add new lines just focus on the request!
